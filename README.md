        <p class="lead">

	There are times when one might look around and realize they need a change in their home. A great way to update is to use tiles, as there are many different options for using tiles in any space of the home. What’s the best part of using tiles? They range from inexpensive to very expensive per square foot, which means there are a lot of options; who doesn't like options?

	One of the most popular ways to add jazz to a room is in the kitchen using wall tiles. Mosaic tiles are best for this type of project as they are smaller. It's possible to create an absolutely beautiful back splash in your kitchen and really wow guests. It's a small and doable job that can completely change the way a kitchen looks. Some like to go for a polished-glam look with a back splash. One idea might be to use soft, neutral colours throughout the home. A ceramic back-splash with a glaze is very attractive to the eye and really pops when combined with this type of look. It's amazing what a difference a change like this can make.
